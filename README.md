# SFDX  App to test Custom Permission

## Resources
Apex Class: CustomPermissionController
Apex Page:  CustomPermissionController
Custom Permissions: Button1, Button2
Permission Set: CustomPermissionController


## Description of Use Case
Permission Set is having only Button 1 Custom Permission and same Permission Set is assigned to the running user.
Now the apex page will display two buttons - Button 1 and Button 2
Clicking on Button 1 will display True as running user is having custom permission - 'Button1' through permission set
Clicking on Button 2 will display False as running user is not having custom permission - 'Button2' through permission set

You can always change the custom permission assignment and then page will behave accordingly.
